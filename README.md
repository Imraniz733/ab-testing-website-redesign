# 🧪 A/B Testing for Website Redesign: Conversion Optimization Analysis

This project analyzes the effectiveness of a new website design using A/B testing techniques. By comparing user conversion rates between a control group (old page) and a treatment group (new page), we assess whether the redesign leads to a statistically significant improvement in user engagement.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze and clean A/B test data
- Verify experiment design (group/page matching)
- Calculate and compare conversion rates
- Perform hypothesis testing using Z-test
- Provide clear business recommendations

## 📊 Result Summary
The analysis found **no statistically significant difference** between the new and old landing pages (p-value > 0.05). Therefore, it is not recommended to roll out the new design at this stage.

## 📁 Dataset
Sourced from Kaggle

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- statsmodels

## 📈 Business Insight
Although the new page showed a slightly lower conversion rate, the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests more user research or redesign iterations may be needed before launch.
